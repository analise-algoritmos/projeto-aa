abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Sorting algorithms plays an important role in the computer science field. Many applications use sorting algorithm. There are several sorting algorithms proposed by experts, namely bubble sort, exchange short, insertion short, heap sort, quick short, merge sort, standard selection sort. One well-known algorithm of sorting is selection sort. In this journal, discussion about standard selection sort is given with thorough analysis. Sorting is very important data structure concepts that has an important role in memory management, file management, in computer science in general, and in many real-life applications. Different sorting algorithms have differences in terms of time complexity, memory use, efficiency, and other factors. There are many sorting algorithms exist right now in the computer science field. Each algorithm has its benefits and limitations where a trade-off exists between execution time and the nature of the complexity of the algorithm itself. The method is theoretical analysis. Three theoretical analyses are given with deep explanation and analysis. Each with six index arrays, namely with six data on it. The numbers are sorted in ascending order. Pseudo code is also given, to understand this algorithm more thoroughly. It is concluded that this theoretical analysis explained the algorithm more clearly, by using process iteration by hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;}
